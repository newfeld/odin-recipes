    <h3>Recipe Description</h3>
    <p>
        Fried rice is a classic easy and affordable meal, but this recipe in particular is made even easier and more affordable
        with Spam and any vegetables you can find in your fridge. I find myself making this meal when I need to use up any and all ingredients left in the fridge.
        Another essential part of the college experience means using the least amount of dishes possible, and the fact that this dish only requires a single pan or wok
        makes this the ultimate student meal.
