    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This is an age old budget meal enjoyed by students, meal preppers, athletes, and anybody who needs a quick meal due to its simplicity, adaptability,
        and high nutritional value. I like this dish because you can cook the chicken any way you desire with any seasonings and sauces you want and it will pretty
        much taste good no matter what. I like to add kimchi to the side for some color and to make my mother feel better about my dieting habits at school. 
        This recipe is how I typically prepare this dish and will utilize some of Trader Joes' magical ingredients.
